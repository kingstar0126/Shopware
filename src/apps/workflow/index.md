# Workflow

Workflow automates operations of your e-commerce business like checkout process, order transaction, email marketing, customer registration, etc., which streamlines your business and gains better outcomes.

What does the Shopware workflow feature offer you?

* [Automate business process](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/flow-builder/add-custom-flow-actions-from-app-system) - Shopware offers Flow Builder as an automation solution to automate business processes by building workflows. Workflow triggers are events that cause a workflow to run. Hence, to create automation, you need to build a workflow using components called triggers, conditions, and actions.

* [Create Webhooks](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-base-guide#webhooks) - On the other hand, you can send data about events on the server to a web application using webhooks. This is to say that apps offer the possibility to deliver their own flow actions via webhooks. With webhooks, you are able to subscribe to events occurring in Shopware.

* [Generate documents like invoices](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/checkout/document/add-custom-document-type#adding-a-generator) - Document generation automatically creates typical documents used within a business, such as invoices, contracts, order cancellations, and more. These document templates can be customized to have different brand names or personalized marketing messages on invoice templates with a PDF generator. Document automation uses workflows to assist in creating electronic documents.
