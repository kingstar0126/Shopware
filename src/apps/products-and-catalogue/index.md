# Product and Catalogue Overview

A [product catalog](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/concepts/commerce/catalog) enlists essential [product information](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/concepts/commerce/catalog/products) that is categorized well and helps buyers make a purchase decision easier.

Every product can be assigned to categories in [two ways](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/concepts/commerce/catalog/categories#product-assignments).

Products can be made searchable by extending fields of the product entity to the [elasticsearch engine](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/concepts/framework/elasticsearch). This is done via [plugins](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/elasticsearch). They can also be [custom-sorted](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/storefront/add-custom-sorting-product-listing) for product listing.

The [app script](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-scripts) extends data loading, compiles calculations, line-item splitting, cache configurations etc.

The [CMS](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/content/cms) takes care of creating, registering, and rendering new elements.

Refer to [data handling](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/framework/data-handling) to know all the features of the product catalogue, how to read, write, extend and remove them.

Lastly, perform [end-to-end testing](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/testing/end-to-end-testing) of created product and its properties.
