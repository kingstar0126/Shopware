# Content

An e-commerce website is the face of your business, enriched with content (products, categories, orders, etc.) reaching out to the masses, making it possible for merchants to sell their products through this interface.

Content Management Systems (CMS) allows you to create, edit, and publish these contents on your website. You can also customize website representation by modifying the layout and styling of your online store's homepage, product pages, etc. Every category has a CMS layout assigned to it that dictates how it is displayed.

Shopware provides both [static](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/concepts/framework/architecture/storefront-concept) and [dynamic CMS website](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/concepts/commerce/core/shopping-experiences-cms) to facilitates you to create different frontend experiences for different use cases with media (text, images, and videos).

Shopware's headless CMS architecture simply makes content available via [APIs](https://shopware.stoplight.io/docs/store-api/70c7b54c9faf9-fetch-and-resolve-a-cms-page). The custom extensions to CMS can be added via [apps](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/content/cms) or [plugins](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/content/cms).
